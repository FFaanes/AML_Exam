# Exam project for the Noroff Machine Learning course
## Classification of skin-diseases using machine learning
The project report covers all the different techniques used and in detail overview of all the results from the different models trained. The medical field is an exciting field to explore the technology of AI and machine learning,
and will in the future make a big inpact on how the work is done. The models created, used and trained in this project are: Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbour. I also explored different
techniques for data augmentation and pre-processing which gave a wide range of results. Feel free to have a look, and i am avalible to chat about the project if you are interested!
